# üêö ZSH Configuration

This is a custom `.zshrc` configuration optimized for development productivity using **Oh My Zsh**, enhanced plugins, and convenient aliases. It is designed to work well on Linux-based systems with support for Git, Node.js, and shell improvements.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Oh My Zsh** with the `miloshadzic` theme.
- Lazy loading for faster startup (especially for `nvm`).
- Custom prompt with hostname and current directory.
- Enhanced command-line experience via:
  - `zsh-autosuggestions`
  - `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
- Optimized PATH for tools like Yarn and Neovim.
- Useful aliases for Git, system control, clipboard utilities, and more.
- History configuration with a large buffer size.
- Helper functions for system update and Git log visualization.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before using this configuration, ensure you have:

- Zsh installed (`zsh --version`)
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) installed
- `nvm`, `yarn`, `git`, and `tmux` installed
- `xclip` installed (for `pbcopy` / `pbpaste` clipboard aliases)
- `preload` installed (optional for performance tuning)
- Plugins:
  - [`zsh-syntax-highlighting`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
  - [`zsh-autosuggestions`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Plugin Configuration

```zsh
plugins=(
  npm
  yarn
  git
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
  zsh-autosuggestions
)
```

Plugin settings:
- `nvm`: lazy loading enabled to reduce shell startup time.
- `yarn`: avoids using global path detection to reduce conflicts.
- Autosuggestions styled with underline, bold, and color.

---

## üé® Prompt Style

```zsh
PROMPT='%F{240}%n%F{red}@%F{green}%m:%F{141}%d$ %F{reset}'
```

This provides a clean and colorful shell prompt showing:
- Username
- Hostname
- Current directory

## üß† Tips for Customization

- To add more plugins, place them in the `plugins=(...)` array.
- For a random theme every startup, set `ZSH_THEME="random"` and optionally define `ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES`.
- Define personal aliases in the `ZSH_CUSTOM` directory or inside `.zshrc` directly.
- Customize prompt or theme using [Oh My Zsh Themes Wiki](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes).

## üìÇ Path Adjustments

```zsh
export PATH="$PATH:$(yarn global bin)"
PATH+="$PATH:/opt/nvim-linux64/bin"

```zsh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

```

Ensures Node Version Manager (NVM) is available in your shell.
